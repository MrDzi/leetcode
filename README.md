# LeetCode TypeScript Solutions

This project contains solutions to various LeetCode problems organized into three categories: Algorithms, Databases, and JavaScript. Each problem is implemented in TypeScript and includes corresponding test cases to validate the solutions.

## Project Structure

- **src/**
  - **algorithms/**: Contains implementations of algorithm problems.
    - `problem1.ts`: Implementation of the first algorithm problem.
    - `problem2.ts`: Implementation of the second algorithm problem.
  - **databases/**: Contains implementations of database problems.
    - `problem1.ts`: Implementation of the first database problem.
    - `problem2.ts`: Implementation of the second database problem.
  - **javascript/**: Contains implementations of JavaScript problems.
    - `problem1.ts`: Implementation of the first JavaScript problem.
    - `problem2.ts`: Implementation of the second JavaScript problem.
  - **tests/**: Contains test cases for each problem.
    - **algorithms/**
      - `problem1.test.ts`: Test cases for the first algorithm problem.
      - `problem2.test.ts`: Test cases for the second algorithm problem.
    - **databases/**
      - `problem1.test.ts`: Test cases for the first database problem.
      - `problem2.test.ts`: Test cases for the second database problem.
    - **javascript/**
      - `problem1.test.ts`: Test cases for the first JavaScript problem.
      - `problem2.test.ts`: Test cases for the second JavaScript problem.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Compile the TypeScript files:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
4. Run the tests:
   ```
   npm test
   ```
